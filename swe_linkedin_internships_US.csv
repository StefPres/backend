Why BAE Systems? BAE Systems is the third largest defense contractor in the world with an exceptional, mission-focused culture.

The MM III is a strategic nuclear weapon system dispersed in hardened silos to protect against attack, and connected to an underground launch control center through a system of hardened cables. Over 50 years of continuous modernization programs have resulted in new versions of the missile, expanded targeting options, and improved accuracy and survivability. These enhancements serve to keep the MM III viable as until the mid-2030s, when the system is scheduled to be replaced by the future GBSD ICBM now in development.

BAE Systems is also an integral part of the development, deployment, and sustainment of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) ICBM Program.

Our Mission

At Palo Alto Networks® everything starts and ends with our mission: Being the cybersecurity partner of choice, protecting our digital way of life.

Our vision is a world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before. We are a company built on the foundation of challenging and disrupting the way things are done, and we’re looking for innovators who are as committed to shaping the future of cybersecurity as we are.

FLEXWORK is an employee-centric reimagining of how we work. We built FLEXWORK based on employee feedback – it is about flexibility, trust, and choice whenever possible. It’s been a journey of disruption that has yielded the best of our values. We offer as much flexibility as possible, and choices that enable you to be most productive, including benefits that meet your needs and learning opportunities that you feel passionate about.

Your Career

We expect office-based employees to be in the office three days per week, with two days working from where they choose. We believe being together facilitates casual conversations and those magic moments where we can work on issues and ideas informally. These moments build capability and deepen trusted relationships and allow our people to feel safe in taking risks and being disruptive. Like so many companies, we are working through the details and things could change …. but in general if a role is deemed office-based we want our teams to be together three days per week.

We collaborate to build software that does not just work, but also solves real problems. Some of our most impactful projects started off with an engineer asking “why” and working with mentors and peers to create value. You will join a Research and Development (R&D) team that will give you the opportunity to make a global impact. One that protects our way of life in the digital age by preventing successful cyber attacks. A team looking for engineers who are passionate about technology, have an interest in cybersecurity, and also want to make a positive difference in the world that we live in. The projects our engineers are assigned will give real hands-on experience working on our products from our Strata, Prisma and Cortex organizations.

Our Summer Internship Program from May-August or June-September provides you:

1:1 mentorship
Fun and engaging events that inspire your intellectual curiosity
Opportunities to expand your knowledge and work on challenging projects
Connections to other interns, recent grads, and employees across the company as well as our leaders

Your Impact

Collaborate and execute alongside experience engineers
Help us disrupt the cybersecurity industry using the latest and greatest technologies
Write code that meaningfully improves our products and services
Learn about the cybersecurity industry from the world's leading security experts

Your Experience

Currently pursuing a 4-year Undergraduate Degree in Machine Learning, Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Statistics, Cybersecurity, or similar majors and returning to school in the fall
An understanding of the fundamentals of Computer Science
Exemplify strong initiative and ability to work independently with limited direction
Ability to work cross functionally with other engineers, researchers and Product Managers
Excellent communications skills
Interest in Cybersecurity

Requirements – Please note that we will not sponsor applicants for work visas for this position.

Our Commitment

We’re trailblazers that dream big, take risks, and challenge cybersecurity’s status quo. It’s simple: we can’t accomplish our mission without diverse teams innovating, together.

We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all qualified individuals with a disability. If you require assistance or accommodation due to a disability or special need, please contact us at accommodations@paloaltonetworks.com.
