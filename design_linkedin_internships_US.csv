As a leading marketing and communications company, it is who we are as people, what gets us up in the morning, and what keeps us going. Since our founding in 2008, we have been working in the attention business and have helped our clients strategically grow and achieve their business goals.

For the past 15 years, Slice’s team of social media, public relations, content, and email marketing experts have moved clients’ target audiences from aware to advocates through our proprietary 5 Types of Attention model. Our strategic focus on attention is what helps our clients achieve and surpass their business goals time after time.

Here at Slice Communications, we are a tight-knit team of innovative thinkers, seasoned experts, and opportunistic hustlers. We run our business on the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), as outlined in the book Traction. Utilizing the EOS model makes our company extremely goal-oriented and has a high level of transparency across the agency.

Every quarter our leadership team hosts an all-staff meeting where they share updates on how we’re performing against our business goals as well as finances. The agency’s goals are clear and discussed regularly among the team along with a clear line of processes and accountability to achieve each goal. We also operate using scorecards to track our, and our clients, performance week after week. As a data-driven company, being able to see how we’re performing against our KPIs every week attributes to our transparent culture.

As a client-driven agency, we are committed to ensuring we meet our clients' needs and developing trusting relationships with them. That means there are times when we need to meet with them in person, attend their events, have an in-person strategy session, tour their facilities, or just take them out to lunch. There are also two required, in-person Slice events for all full-time employees: the annual Social Media Day PHL conference and the annual holiday party, both of which take place in Philadelphia. Other than those things, our team members are encouraged to work appropriately, whether that is from home, another quiet space, or in our Philadelphia or Wilmington offices.

When meeting with clients or attending events on behalf of the company, Slice team members are the best dressed people in the room. We know that everything communicates, and as trusted consultants to our clients, we need to demonstrate that in how we show up and what we wear. Because we get to know our clients so well, we are in tune with whether a suit jacket or flats or fun earrings are appropriate. We are the best representatives of our brand, and we take that seriously.

We provide equal employment opportunity (EEO) to all persons regardless of age, color, national origin, citizenship status, physical or mental disability, race, religion, creed, gender, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, genetic information, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law.
